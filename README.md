#### Adding a New Package Source

Packistry provides a simple and interactive way to add new sources via an Artisan command. This command allows you to add sources such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea to your Packistry server, ensuring that you can manage your Composer packages from multiple repositories seamlessly.

To add a new package source, use the following command:

```bash
php artisan app:add-package-source
```

This command will guide you through a series of prompts to configure your package source:

1. **Package Source Name**:  
   You'll be prompted to enter the name of your package source.

2. **Provider Selection**:  
   Choose the package source provider from a list of available options like GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea.

3. **Base URL**:  
   Enter the base URL of your package source (e.g., `https://github.com`).

4. **Access Token**:  
   For private provider, you will be prompted to provide an access token to authenticate with the package source provider. The token is encrypted before being stored in the database.

Once you've provided all the required information, the package source will be saved to your system.

#### Importing Packages from a Source

Packistry allows you to import packages directly from a package source (e.g., Gitea, GitHub, Gitlab).

To import packages, you can run the following command:

```bash
php artisan app:import-package
```

1. **Selecting a Repository**:  
   You'll be prompted to choose whether to import the package into the main repository or a sub-repository.

2. **Choosing a Package Source**:  
   After selecting the repository, you will be prompted to select the package source from which to import packages.

3. **Import Process**:  
   Once the import is successful, Packistry will display the name of the imported repository along with a list of:
    - **Branches**: All branches detected from the package source.
    - **Tags**: All tags associated with the package in the selected source.
